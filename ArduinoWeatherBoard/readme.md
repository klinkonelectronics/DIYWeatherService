# Arduino Weather Board v1.1

This is an improved version of the original board that brought life to this project in the 2018. 
Based on an Arduino Nano, it saves the sensors data to an SD card module and display them in a 2004 LCD, printing temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure.

A second release, the one which I decided to revamp last two weeks with a renewed PCB, that actually has the bare minimum requirements to make a simple weather datalogger, I consider it as the really first electronics project that I made

The board version is 1.1 because I put small improvements , as a better voltage regulator, some capacitors to filter the input voltage, analog input/outputs and an expansion board which I'll publish later
